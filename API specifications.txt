API specifications

### Show info
GET /api/shows -> too big? need some limit
GET /api/shows/{id} -> get show data
GET /api/shows/{id}/episodes -> get show data + episode list


### Followed Shows

GET /api/users/{user_id}/shows -> all followed shows
GET /api/users/{user_id}/shows/{show_id} -> get follow status for show_id + show data (not episodes)
POST /api/users/{user_id}/shows/{show_id} -> follow show_id
DELETE /api/users/{user_id}/shows/{show_id} -> unfollow show_id

### Watched episodes
GET /api/users/{user_id}/episodes -> all watched episodes
GET /api/users/{user_id}/episodes/{episode_id} -> watched status for episode_id
POST /api/users/{user_id}/episodes/{episode_id} -> set episode_id watched
DELETE /api/users/{user_id}/episodes/{episode_id} -> set episode_id unwatched

### Watched episodes for show
GET /api/users/{user_id}/shows/episodes -> all watched episodes for all followed shows
GET /api/users/{user_id}/shows/{show_id}/episodes -> follow-status for show_id and possibly watched episodes for show_id
GET /api/users/{user_id}/shows/{show_id}/episodes/{episode_id} -> follow-status for show_id and watched-status for episode_id

POST, DELETE could be added for completeness but would be redundant
